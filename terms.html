                3.1 Proprietary Rights. To the extent not infringing GitHub’s

                interfaces, trademarks, and logo shall remain our exclusive
                property. You may not alter, reproduce, republish, license any
                of our proprietary materials, unless Intel expressly give You a
                written permission to do so. All rights not expressly granted

            <div>
              <p>
                3.2 Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit Intel’s use of
                our knowledge, skills, experience, ideas, concepts, know-how
                and/or techniques developed or learned at any time, without
                limitation. If You provide Intel feedback regarding the use,
                operation, performance, or functionality of our website,
                Services, or business (collectively, "Feedback"), You hereby
                grant Intel a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free,
                and non-exclusive right and license to exploit and commercialize
                the Feedback, improve the Services, and develop and/or
                commercialize new offerings, which Intel will solely and
                exclusively own. In addition, and subject to our Privacy Policy,
                Intel may aggregate, anonymize, or otherwise learn from data
                relating to your use of the Services, and use the foregoing to
                improve those Services.

                licenses (collectively, "Open Source"). The Open-Source license
                terms are not intended to be replaced or overridden by the

                under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and
                conditions of any applicable Open-Source license. If Intel (or
                You) make modifications to Open Source, and if the applicable
                Open Source requires that such modifications be made available,
                and Intel (or You) do not already publish such modifications via
                the applicable open-source community, then modifications will be
                available on applicable websites.
